        <h3 id="blight">What is blight?</h3>
            <p><b>Blight</b> is the decay of a community and its resources. The main sign of blight                   is abandoned buildings and neighborhoods. This fosters the growth crime and lowers                   property values in the surrounding areas.

        <h3 id="problem">Problems Faced in Combating Blight</h3>
            <p>Demolition is becoming harder and harder according to <a                                         href="http://www.macon.com/2014/08/17/3253368_unblight-conference-marshals-                         attention.html?rh=1">this</a> article by the Macon Telegraph. Older homes need to be                 inspected for asbestos and prices for demolition are on the rise. To top it off, even               with the city's plan to demolish houses and buildings on the regular, it won't help much             because there are buildings being abandoned every day.</p>
